# Deep Learning
Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses artificial neural networks to teach computers how to process data in a way that mimics the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize patterns in data like text, images, and sounds to make predictions and insights. 
Deep learning is used in many applications and services, including:
- Digital assistants
- Voice-enabled TV remotes
- Credit card fraud detection
- Self-driving cars
- Generative AI
- Image generators
- Large language models
